ISSUE:       https://http://tracker.red-soft.biz/issues/92275
TITLE:       Uncommitted records may become visible after the database sweep
DESCRIPTION:
    Create a table with field size exceeding db page size.
    Insert one record in the table. Record data must be poorly compressible so that the record is divided into two or more pages.
    Use repeated substring '0123456789'. This way we guarantee that adjacent characters will not be repeated.
    Commit a transaction and close connection.
    Run sweep by gfix.
    Start a transaction with NO AUTO UNDO and insert several uncompressible records into test table.
    Rollback a transaction and close connection.
    Run sweep by gfix again.
    Select count of records in the test table and see that there are more that one record.
NOTES:
    FB/RDB5+ requires only 1 uncommited record but we insert several ones to unify tests.
