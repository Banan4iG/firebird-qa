ISSUE:       5502
TITLE:       SELECT WITH LOCK may raise unexpected update conflict errors under concurrent load
DESCRIPTION:
  Prototype: https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/firebird-support/conversations/messages/128920
  Done with suggestions from dimitr, see letter 01-may-2016 09:15.
  Confirmed on WI-V3.0.0.32366, WI-V3.0.0.32483, 3.0.0.32501 (SS,SC,CS) - it was enough to
  async. start THREE child ISQLs sessions, one or two of them always raise exception after
  few seconds with text: 'deadlock / update conflicts' and could not finish its job.
NOTES:
[12.08.2018]
  It is unclear now how this test can be implemented on 4.0 after introduction of READ CONSISTENCY
  with default value ReadConsistency = 1. According to doc:
  ===
    If ReadConsistency set to 1 (by default) engine ignores
    [NO] RECORD VERSION flags and makes all read-committed
    transactions READ COMMITTED READ CONSISTENCY.
  ===

  Also, doc\\README.read_consistency.md  says that:
  "Old read-committed isolation modes (**RECORD VERSION** and **NO RECORD VERSION**) are still
  allowed but considered as legacy and not recommended to use."

  This mean that one can NOT to check issues of this ticket under 4.0 using default (and recommended)
  value of config parameter 'ReadConsistency'.
  For that reason it was decided to make new EMPTY section of test for 4.0.
