# title:        Regression: generators can be seen/modified by unprivileged users
# decription:
#                   We create sequence ('g') and three users and one role.
#                   First user ('big_brother') is granted to use generator directly.
#                   Second user ('bill_junior') is gratned to use generator via ROLE ('stockmgr').
#                   Third user ('maverick') has no grants to use neither on role nor on generator.
#                   Then we try to change value of generator by call gen_id(g,1) by create apropriate
#                   connections (for each of these users).
#                   First and second users must have ability both to change generator and to see its
#                   values using command 'SHOW SEQUENCE'.
#                   Also, we do additional check for second user: try to connect WITHOUT specifying role
#                   and see/change sequence. Error must be in this case (SQLSTATE = 28000).
#                   Third user must NOT see neither value of generator nor to change it (SQLSTATE = 28000).
#
#                   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: NB ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#                   18.08.2020. FB 4.x has incompatible behaviour with all previous versions since build 4.0.0.2131 (06-aug-2020):
#                   statement 'CREATE SEQUENCE <G>' will create generator with current value LESS FOR 1 then it was before.
#                   Thus, 'create sequence g;' followed by 'show sequence;' will output "current value: -1" (!!) rather than 0.
#                   See also CORE-6084 and its fix: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/23dc0c6297825b2e9006f4d5a2c488702091033d
#                   ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#                   This is considered as *expected* and is noted in doc/README.incompatibilities.3to4.txt
#
#                   Because of this, it was decided to filter out concrete values that are produced in 'SHOW SEQUENCE' command.
#
