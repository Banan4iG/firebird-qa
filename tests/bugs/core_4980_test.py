ISSUE:       5271
TITLE:       Operator REVOKE can modify rights granted to system tables at DB creation time
DESCRIPTION:
  We create here NON-privileged user and revoke any right from him. Also create trivial table TEST.
  Then try to connect with as user and query non-system table TEST and system tables.
  Query to table TEST should be denied, but queries to RDB-tables should run OK and display their data.

FBTEST:      bugs.core_4980
