# title:        Pool of external connections
# decription:   
#                   Test assumes that firebird.conf contains:
#                     ExtConnPoolSize = 100 (or at any other value >= 6)
#                     ExtConnPoolLifeTime = 10
#                   We run six execute blocks with COMMIT after each of them.
#                   When EDS pool is enabled then every new execute block will use the same attachment as it was established in the 1st EB.
#                   We check this by running query that show number of duplicates for each of N attachments: this number must be equal to N-1.
#                   ::: NB ::: 
#                   Final statement must be 'ALTER EXTERNAL CONNECTIONS POOL CLEAR ALL' otherwise DB file will be kept by engine at least 
#                   for 10 seconds after this test finish (see parameter 'ExtConnPoolLifeTime').
#
