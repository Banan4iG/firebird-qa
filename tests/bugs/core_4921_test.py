# title:        Predicate IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM is not pushed into unions/aggregates thus causing sub-optimal plans
# decription:   
#                  Implementation for 3.0 does NOT use 'set explain on' (decision after discuss with Dmitry, letter 02-sep-2015 15:42).
#                  Test only checks that:
#                  1) in case when NATURAL scan occured currently index T*_SINGLE_X is used;
#                  2) in case when it was only PARTIAL matching index Y*_COMPOUND_X is in use.
#                  Checked on: 3.0.0.32020 and 2.5.5.26926 - all versions before those produced suboptimal of inefficient plan.
