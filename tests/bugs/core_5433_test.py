ISSUE:       5705
TITLE:       Minor performance optimization - avoid additional database attachment from security objects mapping code
DESCRIPTION:
  After discuss with Alex (letters 08-10 mar 2017) it was decided to estimate effect of optimization
  by evaluating difference of attachment_id between two subsequent connections to DB.
  NB: Alex said that there was no way to see special service attachment because is was made with turned off
  ability to trace it (see letter 09-mar-2017 16:16).

  SuperServer will have diff=3 (THREE) attachment_id because of CacheWriter and GarbageCollector.
  For that reason we detect FB architecture here and SKIP checking SS results by substitution of
  dummy "OK" instead.
JIRA:        CORE-5433
