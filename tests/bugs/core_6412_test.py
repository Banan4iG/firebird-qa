ID:          issue-6650
ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/6650
TITLE:       Firebird is freezing when trying to manage users via triggers
DESCRIPTION:
    Confirmed hang on 4.0.0.2214

    Checked on 4.0.0.2249 - no hang, but if this test runs in loop, w/o pauses for at
    least ~4s, then starting from 2nd run following fail raises:
        Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 08006
        Error occurred during login, please check server firebird.log for details
        Error occurred during login, please check server firebird.log for details
    This was because of: http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-6441 (fixed).
    Content of firebird.log will be added with following lines:
        Srp Server
        connection shutdown
        Database is shutdown.
    Sent report to Alex et al, 09.11.2020.
JIRA:        CORE-6412
FBTEST:      bugs.core_6412
NOTES:
    [17.08.2022] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Test uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias (see variable REQUIRED_ALIAS)
       and SecurityDatabase in its details which points to that alias, thus making such
       database be self-security. Database file for that alias must NOT exist in the
       QA_root/files/qa/ subdirectory: it will be created here.
       Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace
       it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    3. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)

    Confirmed again problem: 4.0.0.2214 hangs.
    Checked on 5.0.0.623, 4.0.1.2692 - both on Windows and Linux.
