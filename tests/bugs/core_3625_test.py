ISSUE:       3977
TITLE:       MON$IO_STATS doesn't report page writes performed asynchronously (at the AST level)
DESCRIPTION:
  Thanks to dimitr for suggestions about how this test can be implemented.
  We have to read some part of data from table by "att_watcher", make small change in this table
  by "att_worker" and finaly do commit + once again read this table in "att_watcher".
  Counter mon$page_writes that will be obtained twise by "att_watcher" (before its two changes)
  must differ.

  ::: NOTE-1 :::
  We have to analyze counter mon$page_writes for attachment that is called "att_watcher" here,
  despite that it does NOT change any in queried table!

  ::: NOTE-2 :::
  Superserver should *not* be processed by this test because page cache is shared between all
  attachments thus counter mon$page_writes is NOT changed in this scenario.
  For this reason in SS we can only "simulate" proper outcome.
JIRA:        CORE-3625
