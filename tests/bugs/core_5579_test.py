ISSUE:       5846
TITLE:       request synchronization error in the GBAK utility (restore)
DESCRIPTION:
  Database for this test was created beforehand on 2.5.7 with intentionally broken not null constraint.
  It was done using direct RDB$ table modification:
  ---
   recreate table test(id int not null,fn int);
   insert into test(id, fn) values(1, null);
   insert into test(id, fn) values(2, null); -- 2nd record must also present!
   commit;
   -- add NOT NULL, direct modify rdb$ tables (it is allowed before 3.0):
   update rdb$relation_fields set rdb$null_flag = 1
   where rdb$field_name = upper('fn') and rdb$relation_name = upper('test');
   commit;
  ---
  We try to restore .fbk which was created from that DB on current FB snapshot and check that restore log
  does NOT contain phrase 'request synchronization' in any line.
