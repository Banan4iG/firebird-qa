ISSUE:       2067
TITLE:       Non-privileged monitoring reports wrong attachment data
DESCRIPTION:
  When non-SYSDBA user selects from MON$ATTACHMENTS and other attachments are active at this point,
  the resulting rowset refers to a wrong attachment (the one with minimal ID) instead of the current attachment.
