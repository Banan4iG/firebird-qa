ISSUE:       5706Read-only transactions in SuperServer could avoid immediate write of Header
  and TIP pages after changeIncorrect results when left join on subquery with constant column
DESCRIPTION:
  If current FB arch is SuperServer then we:
    1. We make 'snapshot' of mon$io_stats.mon$page_writes value before test and then launch plently transactions (e.g, 50)
       in READ-ONLY mode. All of them then are immediately committed, w/o any actions.
    2. After this we take 2nd 'snapshot' of mon$io_stats.mon$page_writes and compare it with 1st one.
    3. Difference of 'mon$page_writes' values should be 1 (One).
  Otherwise (SC/CS) we defer checking because improvement currently not implemented for these modes.
