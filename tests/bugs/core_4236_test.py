ISSUE:       4560
TITLE:       Database shutdown is reported as successfully completed before all active connections are in fact interrupted
DESCRIPTION:
  Test restores database with single table of following DDL:
    create table test(s varchar(1000));
    create index test_s on test(s);
  Than we start asynchronously several ISQL attachments which will do 'heavy DML' job: insert lot of rows in this table.
  After some delay (IMO, it should be at least 15..20 seconds) we start process of SHUTDOWN but with target mode = 'single'
  instead of 'full'.
  After control will return from shutdown command, we can ensure that database has no any access and its file is closed
  - this is done by call FBSVCMGR utility with arguments: action_repair rpr_validate_db rpr_full. This will launch process
  of database validation and it requires exclusive access, like 'gfix -v -full'.
  If validation will be able to open database in exclusive mode and do its job than NO any output will be produced.
  Any problem with exclusive DB access will lead to error with text like: "database <db_file> shutdown".
  Finally, we check that:
  1) output of validation is really EMPTY - no any rows should present between two intentionally added lines
    ("Validation start" and "validation finish" - they will be added only to improve visual perception of log);
  2) Every launched ISQL was really able to perform its task: at least to insert 100 row in the table, this result should
     be reflected in its log by message 'INS_PROGRESS ...' - it is suspended from EB every 100 rows.
  3) Every launched ISQL was really received exception with SQLCODE = HY000 - it also should be added at the end of ISQL log.

  Checked on WI-V3.0.0.32253, SS/SC/CS (OS=Win XP), with 30 attachments that worked for 30 seconds.
  NB: Issue about hang CS was found during this test implementation, fixed here:
  http://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/62737

  Refactored 13-aug-2020:
    validation result is verified by inspecting difflib.unified_diff() result between firebird.log that was
    before and after validation: it must contain phrase "Validation finished: 0 errors"
    (we check that both validation *did* complete and absense of errors in DB).
