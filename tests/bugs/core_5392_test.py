ISSUE:       5665
TITLE:       BUGCHECK 179 (decompression overran buffer) or unexpected lock conflict may happen during record versions backout
DESCRIPTION:
  NOTE: bug can be reproduced only in SuperServer arch.

  We determine FB arch, and if it is SuperServer then change FW to OFF, add rows into table and
  perform statements that should raise internal FB CC.
  If no errors occures then ISQL log should contain number of affected rows.
  If internal FB CC will occur again then control will be returned to fbtest after ~2 minutes.

  For SS test lasts about 40 seconds, for SC/CS it should pass instantly because we SKIP entire test
  for both SC and CS architectures and just print 'OK' for matching expected_stdout.
