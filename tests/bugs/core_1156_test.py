ISSUE:       1577
TITLE:       Prepare fails when having a parameter in a DSQL statement before a sub query
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
[19.1.2022]
  Using WITH for prepare() call is important to dispose returned prepared statement before
  connection is closed. Otherwise pytest will report unhandled exceptions in __del__ calls
  as prepared statement objects are destructed at wrong time.
JIRA:        CORE-1156
