ISSUE:       5491
TITLE:       Firebird 3.0 + fbclient 3.0 - POST_EVENT won't work
DESCRIPTION:
  We create database-level trigger which sends event with name 'dml_event' on COMMIT.
  Then we do new connect and run thread with INSERT statement (with delay = 1.0 second), and wait
  NO MORE than <max4delivering> sec.
  We should receive event during ~ 1.0 second.
  We have to consider result as FAIL if we do not receive event in <max4delivering> seconds.
  Result of "events.wait(max4delivering)" will be non-empty dictionary with following key-value:
    {'dml_event': 1} - when all fine and client got event;
    {'dml_event': 0} - when NO event was delivered
  All such actions are repeated several times in order to increase probability of failure if something
  in FB will be broken.
JIRA:        CORE-5210
