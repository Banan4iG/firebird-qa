ISSUE:       4231
TITLE:       High memory usage when PSQL code SELECT's from stored procedure which modified some data
DESCRIPTION:
  Test does <run_cnt> calls of selectable SP which performs DML inside itself.
  After every call we store value of db_info(fdb.isc_info_current_memory) as new element in list.
  After all calls finish we scan list for difference between adjacent elements which exceeds
  <max_mem_leak> threshold.
  Value of this threshold depends on FB engine version.

  On current FB versions memory usage is incremented (after every call of SP, w/o commit) by:
  1) ~ 14500 bytes for 3.0
JIRA:        CORE-3895
