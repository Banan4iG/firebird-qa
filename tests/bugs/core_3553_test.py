ISSUE:       3909
TITLE:       Nested loop plan is chosen instead of the sort merge for joining independent
  streams using keys of different types
DESCRIPTION:
JIRA:        CORE-3553
FBTEST:      bugs.core_3553
NOTES:
    [07.04.2022] pzotov
    FB 5.0.0.455 and later: data sources with equal cardinality now present in the HASH plan in order they are specified in the query.
    Reversed order was used before this build. Because of this, two cases of expected stdout must be taken in account, see variables
    'fb3x_checked_stdout' and 'fb5x_checked_stdout'.
