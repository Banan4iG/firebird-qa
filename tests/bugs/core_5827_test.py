ISSUE:       6088
TITLE:       ALTER CURRENT USER fails with "no permission for <...> TABLE PLG$SRP" if current user: 1) has NO admin role and 2) wants to modify his own TAGS list
DESCRIPTION:
  Code of this test must to be changed after ticket will be fixed!
  See line with 'grant admin role' -- it must me COMMENTED.
  Also, min_version should be set to 3.0.x rather than 4.0.0

  Currently we check only ability to change TAGS list using 'ALTER CURRENT USER' statement.
  See also test for CORE-3365, but it checks only 'old' attributes which existed before FB 3.0.
JIRA:        CORE-5827
