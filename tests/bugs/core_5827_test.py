# title:        ALTER CURRENT USER fails with "no permission for <...> TABLE PLG$SRP" if current user: 1) has NO admin role and 2) wants to modify his own TAGS list
# decription:   
#                   ::: NB :::
#                   Code of this test must to be changed after ticket will be fixed!
#                   See line with 'grant admin role' -- it must me COMMENTED.
#                   Also, min_version should be set to 3.0.x rather than 4.0.0
#               
#                   Currently we check only ability to change TAGS list using 'ALTER CURRENT USER' statement.
#                   See also test for CORE-3365, but it checks only 'old' attributes which existed before FB 3.0.
