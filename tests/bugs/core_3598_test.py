ISSUE:       3952
TITLE:       TRACE: add statistics of actions that were after transaction finished
DESCRIPTION:
  Three tables are created: permanent, GTT with on commit PRESERVE rows and on commit DELETE rows.

  Trace config is created with *prohibition* of any activity related to security<N>.fdb
  but allow to log transactions-related events (commits and rollbacks) for working database.
  Trace is started before furthe actions.

  Then we launch ISQL and apply two DML for each of these tables:
  1) insert row + commit;
  2) insert row + rollback.

  Finally (after ISQL will finish), we stop trace and parse its log.
  For *each* table TWO lines with performance statristics must exist: both for COMMIT and ROLLBACK events.
