ISSUE:       5482
TITLE:       Return nonzero result code when restore fails on activating and creating deferred user index
DESCRIPTION:
  According to Alex response on letter 25-apr-2016 19:15, zero retcode returned ONLY when restore
  was done WITH '-verbose' switch, and this was fixed. When restoring was done without additional
  switches, retcode was NON zero and its value was 1.

  We create table with UNIQUE computed-by index which expression refers to other table (Firebird allows this!).
  Because other table (test_2) initially is empty, index _can_ be created. But after this we insert record into
  this table and do commit. Since that moment backup of this database will have table test_1 but its index will
  NOT be able to restore (unless '-i' switch specified).
  We will use this inability of restore index by checking 'gbak -rep -v ...' return code: it should be NON zero.
 If code will skip exception then this will mean FAIL of test.
