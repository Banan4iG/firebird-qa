ISSUE:       6520
TITLE:       Efficient table scans for DBKEY-based range conditions
DESCRIPTION:
  We create table with very wide column and add there about 300 rows from rdb$types, with random data
  (in order to prevent RLE-compression which eventually can reduce number of data pages).
  Then we extract all values of rdb$db_key from this table and take into processing two of them.
  First value has 'distance' from starting db_key = 1/3 of total numbers of rows, second has similar
  distance from final db_key.
  Finally we launch trace and start query with SCOPED expression for RDB$DB_KEY:
    select count(*) from tmp_test_6278 where rdb$db_key between ? and ?

  Trace must contain after this explained plan with "lower bound, upper bound" phrase and table statistics
  which shows number of reads = count of rows plus 1.

  Before fix trace table statistics did not reflect scoped WHERE-expression on RDB$DB_KEY column.
