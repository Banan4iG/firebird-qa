# title:        Wrong current timestamp evaluation for selectable procedures
# decription:   In our implementation, CURRENT_DATE/TIME[STAMP] values are evaluated at the request (aka SQL statement) start time and are permanent for the duration of that request. This rule includes the nested calls (procedures and triggers) as well, i.e. they inherit the parent's timestamp, thus providing the stable date-time value for the entire call stack. However, this rule is broken for selectable procedures that evaluate current date-time values at every invocation.
