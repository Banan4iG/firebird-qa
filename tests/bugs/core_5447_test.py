ISSUE:       5718
TITLE:       EXECUTE STATEMENT <e> when <e> starts with '--' issues -Unexpected ... column <NNN>, value <NNN> is invalid and can change randomly
DESCRIPTION:
  We run EB that is show in the ticket three times, with redirection STDOUT and STDERR to separate files.
  Then we open file of STDERR and parse it: search for lines which contain "-Unexpected end of command" text.
  Extract nineth word from this and add it to Python structure of type = SET.
  Finally, we check that this set:
  1) all columns are positive integers;
  2) contains only one element (i.e. all columns have the same value).
