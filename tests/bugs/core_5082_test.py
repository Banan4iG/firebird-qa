# title:        Server does not validate correctness of user/password pair provided in EXECUTE STATEMENT operator
# decription:   
#                   Confirmed on build 32136 (RC1), build 32181: wrongly displayed names of non-existent user 'TMP$C5082'
#                   and user SYDSDBA that login was provided with wrong (but NOT empty) password.
#                   NOTE: check does NOT perform inside ES when password is empty string or any number of ascii_char(32) 
#                   and 'new' user specified is equal to user name that was used to login - see examples here when password
#                   for SYSDBA is '' or ascii_char(32).
#               
#                   06.02.2019: added separate code for 4.0 because of new error message ("Missing security context for ...")
#                   Checked on: 4.0.0.1421 SS, CS.
#               
#               
#                   30.12.2019: removed check for all detailed messages about error except SQLSTATE:
#                   it is enough to check that server does not allow to perform such logins.
#                   Checked on:
#                       4.0.0.1712 SS: 1.134s.
