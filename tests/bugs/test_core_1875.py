# title:        Error on script with current_date
# decription:   
#                   Confirmed bug on: 2.1.0.17798, result was:
#                   ===
#                       Statement failed, SQLCODE = -902
#                       Unable to complete network request to host "localhost".
#                       -Error reading data from the connection.
#                       Connection rejected by remote interface
#                   ===
#                   Works fine on: 2.1.1.17910.
#                   Also checked on:
#                       build 2.5.9.27107: OK, 0.391s.
#                       build 3.0.4.32924: OK, 2.610s.
#                       build 4.0.0.916: OK, 1.515s.
#                   PS. 
#                   It seems that bug was somehow related to "if" statement. For example, following statements:
#                       select 1 from new_table nt where nt.data_reg = cast(current_date as date) into c;
#                   or:
#                       select 1 from rdb$database
#                       where not exists(
#                           select 1 from new_table nt where nt.data_reg = cast(current_date as date)
#                       )
#                       into c;
#                   -- finished without errors.
