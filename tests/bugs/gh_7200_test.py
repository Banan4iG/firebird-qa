ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7200
TITLE:       DROP DATABASE lead FB to hang if it is issued while DB encrypting/decrypting is in progress
DESCRIPTION:
  Test creates database that will be droppped MANUALLY (i.e. by this test itself, not by fixture).
  This database will contain table with wide indexed column and add some data to it, and its FW will be set to ON.
  Volume of data must be big enough so that the encryption thread will not complete instantly.

  Then 'ALTER DATABASE ENCRYPT...' is issued by ISQL which is launched ASYNCHRONOUSLY, and we start
  loop with query: 'select mon$crypt_state from mon$database'.
  As far as query will return columd value = 3 ("is encrypting") - we break from loop and try to DROP database.
  Attempt to drop database which has incompleted encryption must raise exception:
      lock time-out on wait transaction
      -object is in use
  Test verifies that this exception actually raises (i.e. this is EXPECTED behaviour).

  ::: NB ::: 03-mar-2023.
  We have to run second ISQL for DROP DATABASE (using 'act_tmp.isql(...)' for that).
  Attempt to use drop_database() of class Connection behaves strange on Classic: it does not return exception 'obj in use'
  and silently allows code to continue. The reason currently is unknown. To be discussed with pcisar/alex et al.

NOTES:
    [03.03.2023] pzotov
    0. On SuperServer FB 4.0.2.2772 hanged. On Classic another problem did exist: DROP DATABASE could start only after encryption
       completed (i.e. until value MON$CRYPT_STATE will not changed from 3 to 1).
    1. Settings for encryption are taken from act.files_dir/'test_config.ini' file.
    2. We have to avoid usage of act_tmp.db.drop_database() because it suppresses any occurring exception.
    3. Confirmed problem on 4.0.2.2772 SS (02-jun-2022), 5.0.0.236 SS (30-sep-2021) - test hangs.
       ::: NB :::
       FB 5.x seems to be escaped this problem much earlier than FB 4.x. Build 5.0.0.240 (01-oct-2021) altready NOT hangs.
       Checked on 5.0.0.961 SS, 4.0.3.2903 SS - all fine.

    [2.03.2023] Zuev
    Disable the test until RdbCrypt is added.
