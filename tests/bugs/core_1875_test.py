ISSUE:       2306
TITLE:       Error on script with current_date
DESCRIPTION:
  It seems that bug was somehow related to "if" statement. For example, following statements:
    select 1 from new_table nt where nt.data_reg = cast(current_date as date) into c;
  or:
    select 1 from rdb$database
    where not exists(
        select 1 from new_table nt where nt.data_reg = cast(current_date as date)
    )
    into c;
  -- finished without errors.
JIRA:        CORE-1875
