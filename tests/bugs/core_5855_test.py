ISSUE:       6115
TITLE:       Latest builds of Firebird 4.0 cannot backup DB with generators which contains space in the names
DESCRIPTION:
  Decided to apply test also against Firebird 3.x
NOTES:
  As of nowadays, it  is still possible to create sequence with name = single space character.
  See note in ticket, 26/Jun/18 07:58 AM.
JIRA:        CORE-5855
