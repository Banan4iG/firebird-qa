# title:        Message length error with COALESCE and TIME/TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE and WITH TIME ZONE
# decription:   
#                  Test uses EXECUTE BLOCK with dummy variable to store reuslt (w/o suspend in order to prevent any output).
#                  EXECUTE STATEMENT must be used here for reproducing problem (no error with static PSQL code).
#               
#                  Confirmed bug on 4.0.0.2173.
#                  Checked on 4.0.0.2188 -- all fine.
