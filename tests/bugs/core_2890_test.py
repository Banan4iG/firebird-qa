#                  Despite of ticket's issue that it was fixed to 2.5.1, test script from here will output
#                  NOT ALL rows in WI-V2.5.1.26351 (official 2.5.1 release):

#                   -- will not be displayed.
#                  For this reason it was decided to specify min_version = 2.5.2 rather than 2.5.1
