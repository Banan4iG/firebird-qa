ISSUE:       4176
TITLE:       Usage of a NATURAL JOIN with a derived table crashes the server
DESCRIPTION:
JIRA:        CORE-3834
FBTEST:      bugs.core_3834
NOTES:
    [07.04.2022] pzotov
    1. No need to use .fbk from original ticket: FB 2.5.0 crashes when executing trivial query to mon$ tables.
      File 'core3834.fbk' can be removed from repo.
    2. FB 5.0.0.455 and later: data sources with equal cardinality now present in the HASH plan in order they are specified in the query.
       Reversed  order was used before this build. Because of this, two cases of expected stdout must be taken in account, see variables
       'fb3x_checked_stdout' and 'fb5x_checked_stdout'.
