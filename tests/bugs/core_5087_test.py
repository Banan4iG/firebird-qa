ISSUE:       5372
TITLE:       Database shutdown can cause server crash if multiple attachments run EXECUTE STATEMENT
DESCRIPTION:
     Test makes two copies of current DB file (and closes db_conn after this):
     1) to <db_dml_sessions> - for use by launching ISQL sessions which will perform "heavy DML" (insert rows in the table with wide-key index);
     2) to <db_verify_alive> - for use to verify that FB is alive after we change state of <db_dml_sessions> while ISQL sessions running.

     Then we establish connect to <db_verify_alive> database (see 'att_chk').
     If FB is alive after DML and shutdown then we have to see alive connection to <db_verify_alive>.
     If FB works as SuperServer/SuperClassic and crashed then this connect will be lost and test fails with Python exception.
     If FB works as Classic then this connect will alive but we can check firebird.log for presense of phrases which testify about crash:
     "code attempted to access" and/or "terminate(d) abnormally". We analyze the DIFFERENCE file between old and new firebird.log for this.

     After this, we establish connection to <db_dml_sessions> (see 'att1') and make INSERT statement to special table 't_lock' which has PK-field.
     Futher, we launch <PLANNED_DML_ATTACHMENTS> ISQL sessions which also must insert the same (duplicated) key into this table - and they hang.
     Table 't_lock' serves as "semaphore": when we close attachment 'att1' then all running ISQL sessions will immediately do their DML job.

     We check that all required number connections of ISQLs present by loop in which we query mon$attachments table and count records from it.
     When result of this count will be equal to <PLANNED_DML_ATTACHMENTS> then we release lock from T_LOCK table by closing 'att1'.

     Futher, we allow ISQL sessions to perform their job by waiting for several seconds and then run command to change DB state to full shutdown.
     This command works without returning to caller until all activity in the DB will stop.

     When control will return here, we check that attachment 'att_chk' is alive. Also, we get difference of FB log content and parse by searching
     phrases which can relate to FB crash.

     We also do additional check: all ISQL sessions should be disconnected with writing to logs appropriate messages about shutdown.
