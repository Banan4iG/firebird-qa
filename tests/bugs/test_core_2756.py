# title:        substring from timestamp - unexpected result
# decription:   
#                   26.01.2019. Note for 4.0.
#                   Made more careful parsing for each token of timestamp because of time-with-timezone introduction.
#                   Checed on:
#                       4.0.0.1340: OK, 2.313s.
#                       4.0.0.1410: OK, 2.360s.
#               
#                   02.02.2019. Note for 4.0.
#                   One need to EXPLICITLY add statement SET TIME ZONE <+HH:MM> at the beginning of test, otherwise
#                   we will get eception because current_timestamp string will have length more than expected.
#                   This is because DEFAULT time zone in FB 4.0 includes REGION NAME ('Moscow/Europe") instead of HH:MM shift.
#                   Checked on:
#                       4.0.0.1421: OK, 1.493s.
