ISSUE:       4922
TITLE:       Add support for having more than one UserManager in firebird.conf and use them from SQL
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
[21.10.2021]
  This test requires Legacy_UserManager to be listed in firebird.conf UserManager option,
  which is NOT by default. Otherwise it will FAIL with "Missing requested management plugin"
  Also, it does not use user_factory fixtures as it's the point to create/drop users in test script.
JIRA:        CORE-4607
