# title:        Add support for having more than one UserManager in firebird.conf and use them from SQL
# decription:
#                  Line "UserManager = Srp,..." has been added since ~MAR-2018 in firebird.conf before every fbt_run launch.
#                  Initial attempt to use Srp failed for following COREs tests: 2307, 3365, 4200, 4301, 4469 - and error
#                  was the same for all of them:

#               [pcisar] 21.10.2021 - This test requires Legacy_UserManager to be listed
#                   in firebird.conf UserManager option, which is NOT by default.
#                   Otherwise it will FAIL with "Missing requested management plugin"
