ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/5160
TITLE:       CREATE DATABASE fail with ISQL
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias (see variable REQUIRED_ALIAS) and SecurityDatabase in its details
    which points to that alias, thus making such database be self-security.
    Database file for that alias must NOT exist in the QA_root/files/qa/ subdirectory: it will be created here.
    
    Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
    (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)

    We connect to currently used test DB (which is created by QA plugin) via local protocol, using appropriate
    'CONNECT' command in the SQL script.
    Then we attempt to create new database using command which was providd in the ticket (only page_size was increased to recent).
    After this, we create user in this (new) database and ensure that this DB has owner = current OS user, is self-security etc.
    Finally, we drop new DB and make connect to 'previous' DB which was created by QA plugin, and check that there is NO user
    which was created in the self-security (just dropped) DB.

JIRA:        CORE-4864
FBTEST:      bugs.core_4864
NOTES:
    [04.08.2022] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)
    3. Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    4. It is crucial to be sure that current OS environment has no ISC_USER and ISC_PASSWORD variables. Test forcibly unsets them.

    Confirmed problem on WI-T3.0.0.31896 Firebird 3.0 Beta 2 (date of built: 02-JUL-2015), but only when
    using ISQL (i.e. like it was specified in the ticked: 'isql employee -user sysdba').
    Current version of firebird-driver can not work with 3.0.0.31896, internal error raises before any connect can be established.

    Problematic statement:
        create database 'tmp_core_4864_alias' page_size 8192 default character set win1250 collation pxw_hun;
        Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 42000
        Dynamic SQL Error
        -SQL error code = -104
        -Token unknown - line 1, column 45
        -sysdba
    If we use script with "CONNECT 'employee' user SYSDBA;" (instead of isql employee -user sysdba) then error looks differ:
        Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 42S02
        find/display record error
        -table PLG$VIEW_USERS is not defined
    (and it raises when we run query to mon$database join mon$attachments left join sec$users).

    Checked on 5.0.0.591, 4.0.1.2692, 3.0.8.33535 - both on Windows and Linux.
