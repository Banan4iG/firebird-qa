ISSUE:       3150
TITLE:       substring from timestamp - unexpected result
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
[26.01.2019] Note for 4.0.
  Made more careful parsing for each token of timestamp because of time-with-timezone introduction.
[02.02.2019] Note for 4.0.
  One need to EXPLICITLY add statement SET TIME ZONE <+HH:MM> at the beginning of test, otherwise
  we will get eception because current_timestamp string will have length more than expected.
  This is because DEFAULT time zone in FB 4.0 includes REGION NAME ('Moscow/Europe") instead of HH:MM shift.
