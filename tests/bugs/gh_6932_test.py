ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/6932
TITLE:       GTT's pages are not released while dropping it
DESCRIPTION:
    We create GTT and add some data in it; file 'fb_table_*' will appear in <GTT_DIR> after this.
    We have to obtain size of this file and invoke os.path.getsize(). Result will be NON-zero, despite that Windows
    'dir' command shows that this file has size 0. We initialize list 'gtt_size_list' and save this size in it as
    'initial' element (with index 0).

    After this, we make loop for <ITER_COUNT> iterations and do on each of them:
      * drop GTT;
      * create GTT (with new name);
      * add some data into just created GTT
      * get GTT file size and add it to the list for further analysis (see 'gtt_size_list.append(...)')

    Finally, we scan list 'gtt_size_list' (starting from 2nd element) and evaluate DIFFERENCE between size of GTT file
    that was obtained on Nth and (N-1)th iterations. MEDIAN value of this difference must be ZERO.

FBTEST:      bugs.core_6932
NOTES:
    [20.06.2022] pzotov
    Confirmed bug on 3.0.6.33301; 5.0.0.169.

    [20.09.2022] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Test uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias defined by variable REQUIRED_ALIAS.
       Database file for that alias must NOT exist in the QA_root/files/qa/ subdirectory: it will be created here.
       Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace
       it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    3. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)
    4. Test exploits ability to get folder where GTT files are created by querying config parameter 'TempTableDirectory'.
       This parameter has PER-DATABASE nature, so we can explicitly define it for pre-created alias in the databases.conf.
       Particularly, we can use the same directory as temp database which is used here also as known pre-defined alias
       with known folder.
       Unfortunately, we can NOT be sure that in case if TempTableDirectory is undefined than engine always will use
       values of FIREBIRD_TMP, TEMP and TMP (it was encountered occasinally 20.09.2022 on FB 3.x, 4.x and 5.x).
       Because of this, test can be perfomed only on 4.x and above.
    5. BEFORE this ticket was fixed, size of GTT grew noticeably only for the first ~10 iterations.
       This is example how size was changed (in percents):
         26.88
         34.92
         12.69
         19.84
         11.91
         10.64
         14.43
          8.40
          7.75
       For big numbers of ITER_COUNT values quickly tend to zero.
       AFTER this ticket was resolved, GTT file size is changed only for 2nd iteration (and not in every measure), for ~6%.
       All rest changes (starting from 3rd measure) must be zero.
    6. Test implemented for Windows only: there is no ability to get name of GTT file on Linux
       because all such files marked as deleted immediately after creation.

    Checked on WINDOWS builds: 3.0.8.33535, 4.0.1.2692, 5.0.0.730 (SS/CS)
