ISSUE:       5175
TITLE:       Better performance of creating packages containing many functions
DESCRIPTION:
    ###### ACHTUNG ######
    Package 'psutil' must be installed before run this test!
    #####################

    Test creates package with N_LIMIT functions and the same number of standalone PSQL functions.
    We measure separately N_MEASURES times duration of:
        1. PSQL object(s) compilation and
        2. COMMIT of their BLR
    Fix that was done for this ticket relates mostly to the RATIO between "1" and "2" and (secondary) to their
    absolute values:

    One may see that although compiling time increased for package and reduced for standalone functions (since RC-1),
    time ot COMMIT was reduced  significantly.

    Test was fully re-implemented in order to take in account exactly *this* change rather than wrong way (when we
    did analysis of ratio between *total* time of compilation + commit for package vs N_LIMIT standalone functions).

    Within each measure we create new database, make its FW equals to OFF and do following:
    * create poackage with N_LIMIT functions
    * commit
    * create N_LIMIT standalone functions
    * commit

    Values of CPU User Time before and after every action are taken. Difference between them can be consider as much more
    accurate time estimation. Then we calculate RATIO between these differences, and so we can evaluate how long COMMIT was
    in comparison to DML.
    We perform this N_MEASURES times and get list of ratios for both cases (i.e. one list for package with N_LIMIT functions
    and second for N_LIMIT standalone functions). Then we evaluate MEDIAN of ratios for each list.
    Finally, we compare these medians with THRESHOLDS, which values have been taken from the table that is shown above,
    with increasing by approx. 20%

NOTES:
    [28.05.2022] pzotov
    Checked on 5.0.0.501, 4.0.1.2692, 3.0.8.33535

    1. It is better to made func 'median()' separate rather than inner.
       See letter from pcisar, 31-may-2022 11:25:
         "In Python, inner function is created anew whenever you call the function,
         just for the time of function invocation. It has it's uses and advantages,
         but it's not generally recommended (it's not like in other languages!)"
    2. Additional testing after get fail with weird message:
       "psutil.NoSuchProcess: process PID not found (pid=16652)" for 3.0.8 Classic,
       captured for: fb_info_b = psutil.Process(fb_pid).cpu_times().
       This could be caused by FB crash. TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER.
