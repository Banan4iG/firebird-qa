ISSUE:       5364
TITLE:       ISQL does not show encryption status of database
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses Firebird built-in encryption plugin wich actually does encryption using trivial algorithm.
    Before running this test following prerequisites must be met:
        1. Files fbSampleDbCrypt.conf and libfbSampleDbCrypt.so/fbSampleDbCrypt.dll must present in the $FB_HOME/plugins folder;
        2. File fbSampleDbCrypt.conf must contain line: Auto = yes
        3. File $QA_HOME/pytest.ini must contain line with 'encryption' marker declaration.
    ### ACHTUNG ###
    Unfortunately, there is no files fbSampleDbCrypt.* in FB 3.x snapshots (at least for June-2022).
    One need to take both thiese files from any FB 4.x snapshot (they have backward compatibility).
    On FB 4.x these files can be found here: $FB_HOME/examples/prebuilt/plugins/
    ###############

    We open connection to DB and run 'ALTER DATABASE ENCRYPT.../DECRYPT'.
    One need to keep connection opened for several seconds in order to give encryption thread be fully completed.
    Duration of this delay depends on concurrent workload, usually it is almost zero.
    But in this test it can be tuned - see variable 'MAX_ENCRYPT_DECRYPT_MS'.
    Immediately after launch encryption/decryption, we run isql and ask it to give result of 'SHOW DATABASE' command.
    If this output contains text 'Database [not] encrypted' and *not* contains phrase 'not complete' then we can assume
    that encryption/decryption thread completed. Otherwise we loop until such conditions will raise or timeout expired.

JIRA:        CORE-5077
FBTEST:      bugs.core_5077
NOTES:
    [06.06.2022] pzotov
    Checked on 4.0.1.2692, 3.0.8.33535 - both on Linux and Windows.

    [20.02.2023] Zuev
    Disable the test until RdbCrypt is added.
