# title:        Handling FP overflow in double precision value when converting from decfloat.
# decription:   
#                    Confirmed wrong result for numbers that have ABS greater than max double precision limit in: WI-T4.0.0.1340
#                    Works fine on: WI-T4.0.0.1457
#               
#                    09.12.2019.
#                    Updated syntax for SET BIND command because it was changed in 11-nov-2019. 
#                    Changed expected std_err: added text with "SQL error code = -303"
#               
#                    Checked on: WI-T4.0.0.1685, 1.38 s.
#                    05.03.2021: added subst.: max. floating point precision on Linux is 15 rather than on Windows (16 digits).
