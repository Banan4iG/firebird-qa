ISSUE:       6636
TITLE:       Error converting string with hex representation of integer to smallint
DESCRIPTION:
  Bug initially was detected when adapted some of GTCS-tests which tries to convert
  numeric values from all possible combinations of datatypes.
  Particularly, conversion error was when try to cast "0x7fffffffffffffff" to bigint.
  See letter to Alex et al, 08-JUN-2020 15:38.

  It was decided to check here not only cast to smallint but also to other integer dadatypes.
JIRA:        CORE-6398
