ISSUE:       6344
TITLE:       Extend trace record for COMMIT/ROLLBACK RETAINING to allow chaining of transaction ids
DESCRIPTION:
    Test prepares trace config with requrement to watch only for TRANSACTION events.
    Then it starts trace session and makes several changes withing retained Tx.
    (this is done by invocation con.commit() method with argument 'retaining = True').

    Every COMMIT_RETAINING event in the trace log must contain following *new* elements:
    1) "INIT_" token with ID of transaction that originated changes; it must be shown in the same line with "TRA_" info;
    2) "New number <NN>" - ID that will be assigned to the next transaction in this 'chain'; it must be shown in separate line.

    All lines containing "INIT_" must have the same value of transaction that started changes but this value itself can depend
    on FB major version and (maybe) of server mode: CS / SC /SS. For this reason we must save this number as special 'base' that
    will be subtracted from concrete values during parsing of trace lines - see 'tx_base' variable here.

    We parse trace log and pay attention for lines like: "(TRA_nnn, INIT_mmm, ..."  and "New number <XXX>".
    Each interesting numbers are extracted from these lines and <tx_base> is subtracted from them.
    Finally, we display resulting values.
    1) number after phrase "Tx that is origin of changes:" must always be equal to zero;
    2) number after phrase "Tx that finished now" must be:
      2.1) LESS for 1 than value in the next line: "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx..." - for all DML statements EXCEPT LAST;
      2.2) EQUALS to "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx..." for LAST statement because it does not change anything (updates empty table);

NOTES:
    [05-mar-2023] pzotov
        1. Additional transaction is started by Garbage Collector when SuperServer is checked.
           This transaction starts first so it will be seen as Tx with minimal number in the trace log.
           But on some hosts *message* in the trace for this tx can appear *after* common transactions.
           In order to force GC transaction appear always as FIRST in the trace log, we launch AUX connection here, see 'con_aux'.
        2. In SuperServer mode we have to take in account as minimal user Tx = 3 (see START_TX).
           In Classic this tx = 0.
        3. Expected outputs:
            For Classic and SuperClassic:
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  1
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  0 ; Tx that finished now: 1
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  2
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  0 ; Tx that finished now: 2
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  3
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  0 ; Tx that finished now: 3
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  3
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  0 ; Tx that finished now: 3

            For SuperServer:
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  4
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  3 ; Tx that finished now: 4
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  5
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  3 ; Tx that finished now: 5
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  6
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  3 ; Tx that finished now: 6
            Found record with "NEW NUMBER" for subsequent Tx numbers:  6
            Found "INIT_" token in "TRA_" record. Tx that is origin of changes:  3 ; Tx that finished now: 6
