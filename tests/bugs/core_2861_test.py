ISSUE:       3245
TITLE:       Cannot remove user with dot in login
DESCRIPTION:
  Since 10.01.2016 this test (for 3.0) is based on totally new algorithm with checking ability of
  normal work with randomly generated logins. These logins consists only of punctuation chars and
  for sure will have at least one dot.
  The reason of this replacement was failed results on Classic 3.0 when 'gsec' utility is invoked.
  Code for 2.5 was not changed and is preserved (though it was missed for 2.5 before, but it works OK).

  See http://web.firebirdsql.org/download/prerelease/results/archive/  for builds: 3.0.0.32266 3.0.0.32268

  Correctness of current code was verified by batch scenario, totally about ~1500 iterations was done.
  Several samples of logins that were be checked:
     ,(/;.>_:%$^`.&<|#?=[~\\*}-{@)
     >=[{+%\\.&|~$`(;#._,])}?*@:^!
     }^\\*@.)#>|/;&!=~`]<[,?.-:(%.

  NOTE: currently we EXCLUDE single and double quotes from random login because of CORE-5072.

  This login is handled then by both FBSVCMGR and ISQL utilities:
  1) run FBSVCMGR and:
   1.1) add user
   1.2) modifying some of its attributes (password, firstname etc).
   NOTE! We do *not* run 'fbsvcmgr action_delete_user' because it does not work (at least on build 32268)
   ######################################################################################################
   COMMAND: fbsvcmgr localhost/3333:service_mgr user sysdba password masterkey action_delete_user dbname C:\\MIX\\firebird\\fb30\\security3.fdb sec_username john
   STDERR:  unexpected item in service parameter block, expected isc_spb_sec_username
   (sent letter to Alex, 09-jan-2016 22:34; after getting reply about this issue test can be further changed).
  2) run ISQL and:
  2.1) drop this user that could not be dropped in FBSVCMGR - see previous section.
  2.2) create this login again;
  2.3) modifying some of this login attributes;
  2.4) drop it finally.

  See also:
  #2240 ("Usernames with '.' character"; login 'JOHN.SMITH' is used there).
  #3382 (Error on delete user "ADMIN").
