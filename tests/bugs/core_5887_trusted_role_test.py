ID:          issue-6145-B
ISSUE:       6145
TITLE:       Allow the use of management statements in PSQL blocks
DESCRIPTION:
    Role can be set as TRUSTED when following conditions are true:
    * BOTH AuthServer and AuthClient parameters from firebird.conf contain 'Win_Sspi' as plugin, in any place;
    * current OS user has admin rights;
    * OS environment has *no* variables ISC_USER and ISC_PASSWORD (i.e. they must be UNSET);
    * Two mappings are created (both uses plugin win_sspi):
    ** from any user to user;
    ** from predefined_group domain_any_rid_admins to role <role_to_be_trusted>

    Connect to database should be done in form: CONNECT '<computername>:<our_database>' role <role_to_be_trusted>',
    and after this we can user 'SET TRUSTED ROLE' statement.

    This test checks that statement 'SET TRUSTED ROLE' can be used within PSQL block rather than as DSQL.
