# title:        Add optional START WITH clause to identity columns
# decription:   
#                   We create table with identity column and use 'START WITH' clause for it.
#                   Then we add three rows in this table and calculate difference betwee max and min
#                   values of this identity column. In must be equal 2.
#               
#                   ::: NB :::
#                   Behaviour of FB 4.x was changed since 06-aug-2020 when core-6084 was fixed:
#                   now FB 4.x will assign to ID column values which less than FB 3.x for 1.
#                   For this reason it was changed avoid check for concrete values.
#                   Rather, it is enough to verify only difference between max and min ID.
#               
#                   Checked on 4.0.0.2164, 3.0.7.33356.
