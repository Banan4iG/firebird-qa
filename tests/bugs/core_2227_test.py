ISSUE:       2655
TITLE:       Problem with column names with Accents and triggers
DESCRIPTION:
JIRA:        CORE-2227
FBTEST:      bugs.core_2227
NOTES:
    [25.1.2022] pcisar
        For yet unknown reason, ISQL gets malformed stdin from act.execute() although it was passed
        correctly encoded in iso8859_1. Test changed to use script file writen in iso8859_1
        which works fine.
    [06.10.2022] pzotov
        Could not complete adjusting for LINUX in new-qa.
        DEFERRED.
