ISSUE:       5436
TITLE:       Regression: Server crashes when aggregate functions are used together with NOT IN predicate
DESCRIPTION:
  Here we only check that server is alive after running query but WITHOUT checking its data
  (see: "and 1=0" below in HAVING section).
  We do NOT check correctness of query results - this will be done by another ticket, CORE-5165:
  wrong result in 3.0 RC2 and 4.0 comparing 2.5. It's NOT related to this ticket.
JIRA:        CORE-5153
