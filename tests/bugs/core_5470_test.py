ISSUE:       5740-A
TITLE:       Trace INCLUDE_FILTER with [[:WHITESPACE:]]+ does not work when statement contains newline is issued
DESCRIPTION:
  We create a list of several DDLs which all contain NEWLINE character(s) between keyword and name of DB object.
  Then we launch trace session and execute all these DDLs.
  Finally we check whether trace log contains every DDL or not.
  Expected result: text of every DDL should be FOUND in the trace log.
JIRA:        CORE-5470
FBTEST:      bugs.core_5470
