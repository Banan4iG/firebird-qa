ISSUE:       5394
TITLE:       False PK/FK violation could be reported when attachment used isc_dpb_no_garbage_collect flag
DESCRIPTION:
  Fix relates only such transactions that are in the state 'dead', see: https://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/62965
  This mean that such Tx should did sufficiently big changes _before_ inserting key into table with PK/UK.
  Number of these changes should force Tx-1 be rolled back via TIP rather than undo+commit.
  Simple experiment shows that threshold is near 80'000 rows being inserted into the table with single
  text field of length = 50 characters. This test inserts 120'000 rows for ensuring that rollback will be
  done via TIP.
