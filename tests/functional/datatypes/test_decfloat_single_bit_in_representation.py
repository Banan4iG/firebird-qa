ID:          decfloat.single-bit-in-representation
TITLE:       Check result of EXP() which can be represented only by one ("last") significant bit
DESCRIPTION:
  Get minimal distinguish from zero value for DEFCFLOAT datatype using EXP() function.
  Check some trivial arithmetic results for this value and pair of other values which are closest to it.
