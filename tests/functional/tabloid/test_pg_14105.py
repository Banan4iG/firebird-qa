#                     create table a as (select 1 as id);
#                     select *

#               
#               
#                     It works on PostgreSQL 9.2.13., returning:
#                      id | id | id 
#                     ----+----+----
#                       1 |  1 |  1
#                     (1 row)
#                   ===
#                   PS. NOTE on strange form of COALESCE: "coalesce(tt.id)" - it has only single argument.
